Just lauch the ipython notebook to view our report.

In case you need to run our code, download the dataset and put under the root folder, i.e. ./
In other words, the Flickr data should be presented as:
./Flickr8k_Dataset/
./Flickr8k_text

The extracted features should be stored in "./features.pkl" and the model should be stored in "model.h5"
